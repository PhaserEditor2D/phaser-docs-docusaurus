You can change the layout of the views and editors in the window.

In the [main menu](./main-menu) expand the **Layout** sub-menu and select one option:

The **Default Layout** shows all views. Each view in its folder:

The **Large Scene Layout** re-arrange the views and folds the [Files view](./files-view) with the [Outline view](./outline-view), giving all the vertical space to the editor area:
