You can create a prefab instance by dropping a Prefab file into the scene, dragging it from the Files view or the Blocks view.

When the active editor is a Scene Editor, the Blocks view shows the [Asset Pack file](../../asset-pack-editor/asset-pack-file) items and the Prefab files:

You can open the Prefab file of a prefab instance with the **Open Prefab** command. You can press the `F` key or execute the command in the context menu, in the **Prefab** sub-menu:

![Open prefab file of instance.](https://cdn.phaser.io/editor-docs/scene-editor-prefab-open-prefab-file-06082020.webp)

The Inspector view shows a section for each prefab (and prefab variant) of the selected objects. In the menu of the section, you can click the **Open Prefab** option:
