You can create [Polygon](https://docs.phaser.io/api-documentation/class/gameobjects-polygon) object by dropping the **Polygon** block, from the Blocks view, on the scene.

A polygon is made with points. You can edit the points in the **Polygon section** or with the [Polygon tool](../manipulation-tools#polygon-tool).

The Polygon section shows the Points field. The points are presented as a string of the X Y pairs of the points, separated by a space.

The Polygon tool (that you can activate with the `Y` key) shows the polygon’s points in the scene. It allows you:

* Change the position of a point: drag the point with the mouse cursor.
* Delete a point: move the mouse cursor over the point and press the Delete key (or double click). When the cursor is over the point, it is painted in red color.

* Add a new point: move the mouse cursor over a line. It shows a white handler under the cursor, you can drag it for creating a new point.

The [Polygon](https://docs.phaser.io/api-documentation/class/gameobjects-polygon) code is generated by the [scene compiler](../scene-compiler) using the [polygon object factory](https://docs.phaser.io/api-documentation/class/gameobjects-gameobjectfactory#polygon):

```javascript
const polygon = this.add.polygon(10, 10, "0 0 20 70 100 100 80 20");
```
