Arcade is a physics system very popular in Phaser. Phaser Editor provides visual tools for creating and configuring Arcade physics objects.

You can create a `Phaser.Physics.Arcade.Image` or `Phaser.Physics.Arcade.Sprite` game object or you can enable a physics body in any other game object.

With the visual tools, you can change the body size and offset. With the Inspector view editors, you can adjust the physics properties like velocity, mass, etc…
