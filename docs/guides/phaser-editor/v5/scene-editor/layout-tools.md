Laying out the objects in a scene is one of the most attractive features the Scene Editor provides. The Layout tools are shortcuts for aligning and distributing the objects of a scene. You can find the tools in the Layout context menu or the Layout toolbar.

It works this way:

- Select the objects you want to layout:
- Execute a layout operation, selecting a layout tool in the Layout context menu or the Layout toolbar. You can undo or redo this operation:

- If the tool requires parameters, set them in the parameters pane of the Layout toolbar:

  ![Apply layout](https://cdn.phaser.io/editor-docs/scene-editor-layout-tools-steps-2.1-20220812.webp)

You can show/hide the Layout toolbar by checking the **Show Layout Bar** option in the Layout menu:
