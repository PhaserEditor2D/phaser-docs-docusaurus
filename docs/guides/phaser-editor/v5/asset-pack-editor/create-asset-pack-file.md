title: Create a new Asset Pack file
---

The project templates provided by Phaser Editor contain at least one [Asset Pack file](../asset-pack-editor/asset-pack-file). You can use it to configure the assets of your project. However, if you want to load a group of assets at a certain moment of the game, and another group in another moment of the game, you can create a new [Asset Pack file](../asset-pack-editor/asset-pack-file).

To create the new file, open the [New File dialog](../workbench/new-file-dialog) and select the **Asset Pack file** option. It will open the **New Asset Pack File** dialog:

![New Asset Pack file dialog.](https://cdn.phaser.io/editor-docs/asset-pack-editor-new-file-01012022.webp)

Select the folder where you want to create the file and write the file’s name. You don’t need to add the `.json` extension to the file, the dialog does this automatically.

When the file is created, the IDE opens it in the [Asset Pack Editor](../asset-pack-editor).
