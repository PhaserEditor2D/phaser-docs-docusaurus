The [Command palette]() is a dialog that shows the commands available in the **current context**. You can open it by pressing `Ctrl+K` or clicking on the **Command Palette** option of the [Main menu](../workbench/main-menu).

Not all commands are shown, those that do not apply to the **current context** (active view, active editor or active dialog) are omitted.

In the dialog, you can select a command and execute it by pressing the **Execute** button.

Commands are contributed to the workbench, by plugins.

You can change the key bindings of the commands in the [Keyboard settings](../workbench/settings#keyboard-settings).
