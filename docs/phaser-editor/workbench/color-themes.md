Phaser Editor supports a couple of light and dark color themes. You can select a color theme by pressing the `Ctrl+2` keys or selecting the **Select Color Theme** option in the [Main menu](../workbench/main-menu).

The color themes are contributed by plugins. We should write how to create your custom theme in a future Plugin Developer Guide.
