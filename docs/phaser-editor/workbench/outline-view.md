The purpose of the  Outline view is to show the content of the active editor but with a hierarchical structure.

An editor contributes to the Outline view with content but also with a context menu and Inspector view support.

Like the other [content viewers](../misc/content-viewers), it shows an inline preview of the items and can be zoomed in/out, and the content can be filtered.
