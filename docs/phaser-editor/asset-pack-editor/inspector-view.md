The Inspector view connects with the active [Asset Pack Editor](../asset-pack-editor) and shows property editors to change the file configurations.

In addition to property editors, in some cases, the Inspector view shows a preview of the selected configuration.

This preview section is shown when you select a file key in other parts of the IDE, like the Blocks view in the Scene Editor.
