The [Asset Pack Editor](../asset-pack-editor/intro) layout is focused on provides visual and assisted experience. The editor is split into sections, and each section is dedicated to a particular file type. Inside the section, the file configurations are shown in a row layout.

The editor uses a [content viewer](../misc/content-viewers), so it shows an inline preview of the elements, it can be zoomed in/out (pressing `Shift` and rolling the mouse wheel) and filter its context.

In addition, the Outline view provides a hierarchical presentation of the editor content.
