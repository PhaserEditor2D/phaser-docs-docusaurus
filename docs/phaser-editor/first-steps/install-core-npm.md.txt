You can install [Phaser Editor Core](../intro/distributions#phaser-editor-core) globally in your system using [NPM](https://www.npmjs.com):

```bash
> npm install -g phasereditor2d-launcher
```

And you can run it in a terminal:

```bash
$ phasereditor2d-launcher -project path/to/project
```

The [phasereditor2d-launcher](https://www.npmjs.com/package/phasereditor2d-launcher) script downloads the latest [Phaser Editor Core](../intro/distributions#phaser-editor-core) version from the Phaser Editor website and runs it. Next time, the script will use the downloaded editor.

However, probably you would like to install `phasereditor2d-launcher` as a dependency of your project. Then do:

```bash
> npm install phasereditor2d-launcher --save-dev
```

And run it:

```bash
$ npx phasereditor2d-launcher -project .
```

If your project was created using one of the project templates provided by the [Phaser Editor Desktop](../intro/distributions#phaser-editor-desktop) distribution or downloaded from the [Phaser Editor Start page](https://phasereditor2d.com/start), then the editor is installed together with the other dependencies. Also, the `package.json` file contains the `editor` script for running the editor:

```bash
> npm run editor
```
