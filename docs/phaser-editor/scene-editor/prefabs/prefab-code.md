title: Prefab code generation
---

A Prefab file is a scene and is compiled into JavaScript (or TypeScript) code. A regular scene file is compiled into a class that extends the [Phaser.Scene](https://docs.phaser.io/api-documentation/class/scene) class. It is a scene after all. However, the Prefab file is compiled into a custom object class.

The Prefab class generated by the [scene compiler](../../scene-editor/scene-compiler) extends a game object class, like an [Image](../game-objects/image-object), a [BitmapText](../game-objects/bitmap-text-object), etc… or [another prefab class](./prefab-variant).

This is the code generated after compile the **Dragon** prefab:

```javascript
class Dragon extends Phaser.GameObjects.Image {

    constructor(scene, x, y, texture, frame) {
        super(scene, x ?? 100, y ?? 100, texture || "dragon", frame ?? "dragon/flamming_00");

        this.scaleX = 0.7;
        this.scaleY = 0.7;
    }
}
```

Note the Prefab class extends the [Phaser.GameObjects.Image](https://docs.phaser.io/api-documentation/class/gameobjects-image) class, because the prefab object is an [Image](../game-objects/image-object).

The constructor of the **Dragon** class has the same arguments of the [Image](../game-objects/image-object) class, but by default, it uses the texture set in the prefab object. Also, in the body of the constructor, are set the properties modified in the prefab object:

```javascript
this.scaleX = 0.7;
this.scaleY = 0.7;
```

When the [scene compiler](../../scene-editor/scene-compiler) compiles a regular scene file, the prefab instance in it are generated as instances of the Prefab class:

```javascript
class Level extends Phaser.Scene {

    constructor() {
        super("Level");
    }

    create() {
        ...

        // create the instance of the Dragon prefab class
        const dragon = new Dragon(this, 190, 120);
        // add the instance to the display list
        this.add.existing(dragon);
        // modify the 'angle' property of the instance
        dragon.angle = -30;
        ...
    }
}
```

Also, the Prefab class can be instantiated manually by you, at any time in your game. It is just a custom object class that looks like if you write it by hand.
