The script node objects have no built-in properties. When you select a script node in the scene, the Inspector view shows a few sections related only to the editor.

It is the case of the [Variable properties](../game-objects/common-object-properties#variable-properties). Like the game objects, a script node can be referenced by a variable, and you can set its scope to the method, the class, or declare it as a nested prefab:

A script node also can be added to an [Object List](../object-list):

And because it could be created as a prefab instance, it shows the [Prefab Instance properties](../prefabs/prefab-user-properties#user-properties-in-a-prefab-instance):
