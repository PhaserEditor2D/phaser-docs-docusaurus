title: Creating a Script Node
---

A ScriptNode object shares a lot with the game objects, you can add it to the scene by dragging it from the Blocks view and dropping it on the scene:

![Create script node from the blocks view.](https://cdn.phaser.io/editor-docs/script-node-create-1-20230322.webp)

That action creates an instance of the [ScriptNode class](./script-node-class) and adds it to the object selected in the scene. If no object is selected, then it adds the script node to the scene.

In addition to an instance of the [ScriptNode class](./script-node-class), you can add an instance of a [ScriptNode prefab](./script-node-prefab): select the **Add Script** option in the **Scripting** context menu or press the **Add Script** command (`U`).

![Add Script command.](https://cdn.phaser.io/editor-docs/script-node-add-script-dialog-20230627.webp)

It opens the **Add Script** dialog. There you can select the script you want to add:

## Browsing the Script Nodes

The script nodes are displayed in the Outline view, below the parent object, or the scene:

Also, you can browse the scripts of an object by pressing the command `Shift+U`. The command is also available in the **Scripting** section of the context menu. That command opens the **Browse Scripts** dialog:

## Code generation of the creation of a script

When you add a ScriptNode to an object, it generates a code like this:

```javascript
editorCreate() {
    // btn
    const btn = this.add.image(359, 223, "ui", "btn.png");

    // onPointerDownScript
    new OnPointerDownScript(btn);
    ...
}
```

It is the code generated by the [scene compiler](../scene-compiler) when you add a script node prefab. If you add an instance of the built-in ScriptNode, the code is similar, but using the [ScriptNode class](./script-node-class):

```javascript
editorCreate() {

  // btn
  const btn = this.add.image(359, 223, "ui", "btn.png");

  // scriptnode_1
  new ScriptNode(btn);
  ...
}
```

The **ScriptNode** class is not part of Phaser, but it could be generated by Phaser Editor. The next section is about it.
