The [Tilemap](tilemap-object) is a built-in Phaser type: [Phaser.Tilemaps.Tilemap](https://docs.phaser.io/api-documentation/class/tilemaps-tilemap). It is not a display object, it just stores the data of the maps. The display maps are added to the scene using [TilemapLayer objects](tilemap-layer-object).

The Scene Editor only supports maps created by [Tiled](https://www.mapeditor.org) (the popular third-party tool) with the [JSON format](https://doc.mapeditor.org/en/stable/manual/export/#json). Since Phaser v3.50, the following map orientations are supported: Orthogonal, Isometric, Hexagonal, and Staggered.

This is the workflow:

* Create a map with [Tiled](https://www.mapeditor.org).
* Export the map using the JSON format.
* Import the map (and the tileset images) into Phaser Editor using the Asset Pack Editor.
* Create a [Tilemap](tilemap-object) object (and TilemapLayer objects) in the Scene Editor.

To create a [Tilemap](tilemap-object) object, you can drag the **Tilemap** element from the Blocks view and drop it into the scene:

![Drop Tilemap type into the scene.](https://cdn.phaser.io/editor-docs/scene-editor-add-tilemap-1-10152020.webp)

Immediately, it shows a wizard to configure the Tilemap. This wizard shows three pages:

* A page to select the tilemap key (defined in the Asset Pack Editor).
* A page to assign the images to the tilesets of the tilemap.
* A page to select a tilemap layer to be created together with the tilemap. But this one is optional.

The first step is to select the **Tilemap Key**. It is the same key you used to import the [Tiled](https://www.mapeditor.org) JSON map in the Asset Pack Editor:

![Select the tilemap key.](https://cdn.phaser.io/editor-docs/scene-editor-add-tilemap-2-10152020.webp)

Then, the wizard shows the name of the tilesets, and you have to select the image for each tileset. Select a tileset and click on the **Set Tileset Image** button. It opens a dialog with all the images (and sprite-sheets) defined in the Asset Pack files. Also, you can double click on the tileset name to open the dialog:

![It shows the name of the tilesets.](https://cdn.phaser.io/editor-docs/scene-editor-add-tilemap-3-10152020.webp)![Select the image for each tileset.](https://cdn.phaser.io/editor-docs/scene-editor-add-tilemap-4-10152020.webp)

When all the tileset images are set, the **Finish** button is enabled. Click on it to finish the process. Or you can continue to the next page to select a Tilemap Layer. In that case, a new Tilemap and [Tilemap Layer](tilemap-layer-object) are created.

Because a [Tilemap](tilemap-object) is not a display object, it is not shown in the scene, else in the Outline view, together with the tilesets:

![Tilemap object in the Outline view.](https://cdn.phaser.io/editor-docs/scene-editor-tilemap-outline-10152020.webp)

When you select a [Tilemap](tilemap-object), the Inspector view shows some of its properties:

![Tilemap properties.](https://cdn.phaser.io/editor-docs/scene-editor-tilemap-properties-10152020.webp)

Also, if you select the tileset the Inspector view show its properties and the option to change the associated image:

[Tilemap](tilemap-object) objects are code-generated by the [scene compiler](../scene-compiler) using the [tilemap](https://docs.phaser.io/api-documentation/class/gameobjects-gameobjectfactory#tilemap) factory . And the tileset images are created using the [Tilemap.addTilesetImage](https://docs.phaser.io/api-documentation/class/tilemaps-tilemap#addtilesetimage) method:

```javascript
// super_mario_1
const super_mario_1 = this.add.tilemap("super-mario_1");
super_mario_1.addTilesetImage("SuperMarioBros-World1-1", "super-mario");
```

By default, a [Tilemap](tilemap-object) is created with a [CLASS scope](./common-object-properties#scope-property). It means, a field code is generated to reference the object, so you can manually configure other aspects of the map or manually create the layers:

```javascript
this.super_mario_1 = super_mario_1;
```

However, for creating the layers, you have the [TilemapLayer objects](tilemap-layer-object) support in the Scene Editor, which is explained in the next section.
