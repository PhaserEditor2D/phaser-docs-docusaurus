In Phaser, the only game object types that have children are the Container ([Phaser.GameObjects.Container](https://docs.phaser.io/api-documentation/class/gameobjects-container)) and the [Layer](./layer-object) objects. But only the Container can be used to transform the children (in position, angle and scale).

[Learn more about working with parent objects in the Scene Editor](../working-with-parent-objects).

You can create a container by dropping a Container built-in block on the scene,  or with the [Create Container with Selection](#grouping-objects-in-a-container) command.

The code generated by the [scene compiler](../scene-compiler), to create a container, is like this:

```javascript
// x=100, y=20
const container_1 = this.add.container(100, 20);

// some object is created and added to the container
const someObject = ... ;
container_1.add(someObject);
```


## Grouping objects in a Container

There are cases where you need to create a container with a couple of objects. You can do this by selecting the objects and executing the  [Create Container with Selection](#grouping-objects-in-a-container) command.

To execute the command, you can press the `J` key or select it the [context menu](../working-with-parent-objects#parent-context-menu).

1. Select the objects.
2. Execute the command (press `J`).
3. A new container is created.
4. The objects are removed from the original parent.
5. The objects are added to the new container.
6. The new container is [trimmed](#trimming-a-container).

## Trimming a Container

The **Trim Container** command removes the whitespace of the container. This means, that the children are shifted to the left/top corner to the container, and the container is re-positioned to keep the children at the same global position.

To execute this command press the `Shift+T` key or select the **Trim Container** options of the [context menu](../working-with-parent-objects#parent-context-menu).

## Container properties

The container type contains some of the [common object properties](common-object-properties):

* [Variable properties](./common-object-properties#variable-properties)
* [Lists properties](./common-object-properties#lists-properties)
* [Children properties](./common-object-properties#children-properties)
* [Transform properties](./common-object-properties#transform-properties)
* [Visible property](./common-object-properties#visible-property)
