The Shape objects are geometric-based display objects. You can add them to a Scene, a Container or a Group.

All Shape objects extends the [Phaser.GameObjects.Shape](https://docs.phaser.io/api-documentation/class/gameobjects-shape) class and share these common properties:

* [Variable properties](./common-object-properties#variable-properties)
* [Lists properties](./common-object-properties#lists-properties)
* [Transform properties](./common-object-properties#transform-properties)
* [Origin properties](./common-object-properties#origin-properties)
* [Size properties](./common-object-properties#size-properties)
* [Visible property](./common-object-properties#visible-property)
* [Alpha properties](./common-object-properties#alpha-properties)

But they have the following properties:
