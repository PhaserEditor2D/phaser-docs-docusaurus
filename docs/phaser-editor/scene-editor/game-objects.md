title: Game Object types
---

The Scene Editor is in active development and only supports a very basic set of game object types. Eventually, we should add more types and more properties.

However, the way the prefabs work allows to use a Prefab as a black box. This black box can be added to the scene, but you can provide a custom implementation. This technique is covered in the section [Using a prefab as a black box](./prefabs/prefab-black-box). In addition, you can add new game objects [via plugins](../misc/plugins).
