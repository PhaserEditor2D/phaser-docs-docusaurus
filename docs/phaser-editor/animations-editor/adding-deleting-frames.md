The quickest way to create the animations is using the [provided automatic process](auto-build-animations). However, you may want to change the frames of the animations, delete them, or add them.

To delete a couple of frames, select them in the Outline view and execute the **Delete** command (press the `Del` key or select **Delete** in the context menu).

To add frames, select an animation and choose to insert them at the start or the end:

It opens a dialog with all the images-related assets (frames, texture maps, sprite-sheets). You can select the frames to add:
